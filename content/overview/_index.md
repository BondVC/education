About
---

Blockchain is a transformative technology with massive potential, and despite the huge demand from nearly all types of companies, there is a distinct shortage of developers - see this article about how blockchain developers are being offered salaries of 250k. Blockchain at Berkeley offers this course with the aim of fulfilling this demand and giving students with minimal blockchain knowledge a chance to prepare themselves for the industry.

This course is offered concurrently with Blockchain Fundamentals, another Decal which focuses on being comprehensive, interesting, and theoretical and requires no computer science prerequisites. Although Blockchain for Developers and Blockchain Fundamentals can be taken independently, with little overlapping content and co-dependencies, concurrent enrollment is strongly encouraged.

Goals
---
We aim to deliver a holistic experience for different types of blockchain development. The course will emphasize the ins and outs of Ethereum, smart contract security and best practices, integrating with different platforms (IPFS, Oraclize.it, Infura), Bitcoin Script and Lightning Network.

By the end of the course, developers will be well versed in Solidity, from setting up the development environment to writing and deploying smart contracts, the workhorse of blockchain applications. Developers will also gain experience integrating cryptocurrency micropayments into web apps, in addition to being introduced to low-level protocol development.
