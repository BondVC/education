Attendance
---
To reiterate our policy: attendance will be take in class via Google forms. We will allow up to two absences; each unexcused subsequent absence will negatively impact your final grade. Receiving 3 unexcused absences will result in an automatic NP in the course.

If you are planning on missing lecture, please let us know in advance; we're students too and understand that situations may come up from time-to-time.

Assignments
---
All homework and projects will be posted. Assignments will be released on the at the end of every lab. The deadline for each assignment will be the very next Thursday, at 3:30pm.

Office Hours
---
These will take place after every class

Webcasts
---
All lectures will be screencast/recorded and posted on the website. Please bear in mind that this is NOT an excuse to skip attending lecture. Lecture recordings and slides can be found on the website.

Communication
---
The main mode of electronic communication between students and staff will be through Piazza, where we will also make announcements. It is intended for general questions about the course, clarifications about assignments, student questions to each other, discussions about the material, and so on. We strongly encourage students to participate in the discussion, ask, and answer questions through this site. The course staff will monitor discussions closely.

If you need to contact us privately, you should email us at dev-decal@blockchain.berkeley.edu. You can also make a private post on Piazza to get the attention of the whole course staff at once.

Enrollment
---
If you are still on the waitlist, then please do continue to come to class as there may be a small chance of being added to the class roster.
